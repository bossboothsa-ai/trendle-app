KILO MASTER PROMPT — BUILD TRENDLE AS A SOCIAL CREATOR WEB APP (REACT)

Goal
Build Trendle as a modern social web app (creator + check-in + rewards) that feels alive and active, not like a system/dashboard. It must function smoothly on both mobile and desktop (fully responsive). Use React and a clean, maintainable component structure.

Core Product Feel
Trendle should feel like a social creator space (Snapchat/IG Stories energy) + local check-ins + rewards:
- image-first UI
- vibrant, playful, modern
- minimal reading, fast tapping
- micro-interactions (points count-up, quick toasts, subtle animations)
- everything looks like it’s already active in Cape Town (mock real-time feed)

Tech Requirements
- React (Vite preferred) + TypeScript if possible
- Tailwind OR CSS modules (choose one and be consistent)
- Responsive UI: mobile-first, then desktop enhancements
- Routing with React Router
- No backend: use realistic mock data + simulated “real-time” updates via timers
- Must run locally: npm install, npm run dev, open localhost
- Provide clear README instructions

Navigation / Pages
Use bottom navigation on mobile and sidebar/topbar on desktop.
Tabs:
1) Home (social feed)
2) Explore (places)
3) Create (moment post flow)
4) Rewards (prize vault)
5) Profile (creator identity)

Social Features (NEW — required)
Implement social interactions across the app:
- Like posts (hearts)
- Comment on posts (text input + comment list)
- Follow/unfollow users
- User profiles show follower/following counts
- A “Following” feed filter (Home: For You / Following)
- Notifications panel (mock): “X liked your moment”, “Y followed you”, “Z commented”

Points System (UPDATED — required logic)
Keep the existing points and add social points:
Core actions:
- Visit/check-in at a partner venue: +50
- Post a moment (photo): +40
- Add a review caption (if caption length > threshold): +15
- Daily app check-in: +10
- Refer friend (mock): +100

Social actions:
- Follow a user: +5 points (only once per user, prevent farming by unfollow/refollow abuse)
- Like a post: +1 point (cap likes/day to prevent farming, e.g. max 30/day)
- Comment on a post: +1 point (cap comments/day to prevent spam, e.g. max 20/day)

Levels:
- Silver: 0–499
- Gold: 500–1499
- Platinum: 1500+

Show points feedback with micro-animations/toasts:
- “+1 point (Like)”
- “+5 points (Follow)”
- “+1 point (Comment)”

Screen Requirements

1) Home — Live Social Feed (NOT dashboard)
- Top: “Nearby Stories” horizontal scroll of place/photo bubbles (like IG stories)
- Toggle: “For You” vs “Following”
- Floating “Create Moment” button
- Feed: vertical posts with image, caption, user name, place tag, timestamp, points earned
- Each post has: Like button, Comment button, Share (optional), and a Follow button on the user header if not followed
- Live Activity chips: “12 people earned points today”, “3 rewards claimed today”
- Points + Level badge visible but not dominant (small pill)

2) Explore — Visual Discovery
- Visual grid/feed of place cards with big images
- Overlay: name, distance, points per visit, number of active offers
- Place detail page:
  - Moments posted at this place (feed/grid)
  - Offers/rewards available here
  - Check-in button
  - “Create moment here” shortcut

3) Create Moment — Fast Post Flow
- Upload photo (drag/drop + mobile picker)
- Select place (search + recent)
- Add short caption (optional, but rewards +15 if meaningful length)
- Post
- After post: celebration animation + points earned
- New post appears immediately in Home feed

4) Rewards — Prize Vault
- Reward cards with images (coffee/cocktail/discount/cash/airtime)
- Show points required + Redeem CTA
- Lock/unlock based on points
- Redemption modal + toast
- “Redeemed” history list

5) Profile — Creator Identity + Social Graph
- Avatar, username, level badge, total points
- Followers / Following counts (clickable lists)
- Grid of user’s moments
- Stats: visits, posts, likes received, comments received, redemptions
- Button: Edit profile (minimal), View badges/achievements

Mock Data + “Real-Time” Simulation (must feel live)
- Generate realistic Cape Town venue data (CBD + within 10km):
  Examples: The Bean Bar (De Waterkant), Copper & Steam (Buitenkant St), etc.
- Generate 50–100 mock users (names, avatars)
- Generate 60–120 mock posts with realistic captions, place tags, timestamps, likes/comments counts
- Use image URLs placeholders that can later be replaced with AI images; structure data so images swap easily
- Simulate real-time:
  - every 8–15 seconds inject a new post
  - randomly increment likes/comments on existing posts
  - randomly generate “X followed you” events into notifications
  - keep it believable (don’t spam)

Anti-Spam / Farming Rules (important)
- Following points only awarded once per unique follow target
- Daily caps for likes/comments to avoid obvious farming
- Comments must be > 2–3 words to count for points (to prevent “hi” spam)
- Add basic UI messaging when caps are hit (“Daily like points limit reached”)

Visual Design Requirements
- Gen Z, social, lively (NOT corporate, NOT dashboard)
- Image-first UI, rounded cards, soft shadows, clean typography
- Light purple palette with vibrant accents for points/rewards
- Avoid heavy “system” sections; use overlays, chips, floating elements
- Consistent spacing and components across all pages

Deliverables / Output
- Full React project structure with clean components:
  /src
    /components (PostCard, CommentSheet/Modal, FollowButton, StoryRow, RewardCard, Nav, Toasts, NotificationsDrawer)
    /pages (Home, Explore, PlaceDetail, Create, Rewards, Profile, UserProfile)
    /data (mockGenerators, mockData, realtimeSim)
    /styles
- Working routing/navigation
- Fully responsive layouts for mobile + desktop
- README with run instructions and where to edit
- Ensure the app never looks empty: always filled with realistic activity and images.

Constraints
- No real backend
- No empty placeholders
- Must feel like it’s already live in Cape Town with active users, follows, likes, and comments
